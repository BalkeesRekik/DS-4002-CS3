## 📘 Chest X-Ray Classification with EfficientNetV2S

**DS 4002 – Case Study Project (CS3)**
**Created by: Balkees Rekik | Spring 2024**

### 🧠 **Overview**

This case study explores how deep learning can be applied to classify chest X-ray images and assist in detecting pneumonia. It uses a convolutional neural network model—EfficientNetV2S—to process and predict X-ray image labels. The target audience is second-year UVA students interested in data science and healthcare.

### 🧭 **Your Mission**

You’ve joined a startup helping hospitals automate chest X-ray screening. Your job is to review an existing model, evaluate its effectiveness, and think critically about improvements.

Your final deliverable will include:

* An annotated notebook evaluating the model
* A short report reflecting on its performance and limitations

See the **hook** and **rubric PDFs** for full instructions.
